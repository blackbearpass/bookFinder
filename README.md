**Description of the problem, approach, solution**

    As a reader of books I need the ability to quickly search for a new read based on ambigous types of search values.
    
**Reasoning behind your technical choices, including architectural**

    MVC Angular/TS app utilizing a little bit of a service architecture but not fully utilizing a sub-component architecture which is my typical preference for webdev.
    
**Reasoning**

    simple to instantiate, recent experience in leveraging COTS API data and presenting it for 'non-technical' users leveraging the immense libraries of NPM. E.g. Angular Material.
    
**Trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you had additional time to spend on the project. **

    Utilizing Libraries to quickly provide a descent UI with the trade off the investment in putting a larger amount of time into the front/end UI

**Any optional features and enhancements implemented and why**
